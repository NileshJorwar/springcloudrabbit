docker-machine ls

Pull --- List images ---- run command---
docker pull rabbitmq
docker images
docker run image_id
docker ps ---lists the container running image

Instead of pulling you can run it in interactive mode that downloads the image and run for you.


docker tag 6addf4b6a4ef rabbitmq:2
docker tag rabbitmq rabbitmq-latest
$ docker rmi rabbitmq-latest
docker rmi rabbitmq:2
Detached (-d)
To start a container in detached mode, you use -d=true or just -d option. By design, containers started in detached mode exit when the root process used to run the container exits, unless you also specify the --rm option. If you use -d with --rm, the container is removed when it exits or when the daemon exits, whichever happens first.

Do not pass a service x start command to a detached container. For example, this command attempts to start the nginx service.

$ docker run -d -p 80:80 my_image service nginx start
This succeeds in starting the nginx service inside the container. However, it fails the detached container paradigm in that, the root process (service nginx start) returns and the detached container stops as designed. As a result, the nginx service is started but could not be used. Instead, to start a process such as the nginx web server do the following:

$ docker run -d -p 80:80 my_image nginx -g 'daemon off;'

docker ps -a
docker stop container_id

docker search db2
 docker run -it 6addf4b6a4ef /bin/bash --- creates interactive terminal or pseudo terminal for us, allows us to connect to actual rabbit container
running from this docker image.

docker stop container_id
docker rm container_id

docker run -it rabbitmq:management  /bin/bash

Remove the container using docker rm and image using docker rmi

Installing and running rabbitmq docker image---

docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

Docker run to run the image which starts the image downloaded in container which then you can start and stop.

To get the container IP --
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' 067972585ece [last param is container ID] to start the rabbit in local
using ip:15672
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container_name_or_id


Running a command in running container
docker exec -ti 067972585ece   /bin/bash
docker exec -ti 067972585ece   bash
docker exec -ti thirsty_bassi{container_name}   bash

RUN apt-get update (executed during building of image)

--------------------
docker build
docker build -t imageName:tag directoryOfDockerFile
docker run image
----------------
Create the image locally by runnig dockerfile
----- tag the build using docker build -t rabbit:latestversion . (make sure you have kept the local file in same directory where you are running dockerfile.)
----- check the images if built ---- docker images
----- to push it to repository first login ---- docker login -u "nileshjorwar" -p "aaiBaba@93" docker.io
----- Once logged in successfully, push the image --- docker push image_name:tag
----- Denied access
----- Change the tag of image ---- docker tag image_name username/image_name:tag
----- docker tag rabbit-local nileshjorwar/rabbit-local:1.0.0
----- docker push nileshjorwar/rabbit-local

Docker Ports
docker port container_id
docker-machine env
apk
------------------------
Issues -
standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
while building the image locally using dockerfile.
resolution --- open the dockerfile and script.sh file in notepad ++ and goto - EDIT--EOL COnversion---Select LF (unix)
-----------------------
docker cmd vs entrypoint
docker cmd use in Dockerfile ---CMD ["command", "param"]
ex- CMD ["sleep" "5"]

when runs the container, running the container and appending the command sleep 5 at the end
ex -- docker run container_id
which becomes after running
ex -- docker run container_id sleep 5

docker entrypoint use in Dockerfile --- ENTRYPOINT ["command"]
ex- ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
when running in the container, appends at the end of container id but have to specify what param to append
ex - docker run container_id 'param'
(param should be added) or error will occur
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker-compose
a tool for defining and running multi-container docker applications
use of yaml files for configuration -docker-compose.yml
start and stop all services using docker compose up/down
docker-compose is installed as a part of docker toolbox
